# Craigslist Automative Search

## Goal and Use Case:
Often time marketplace websites have hundred of listings. Within those listings, there are items that are often highly in demand. These items and listings are usually contacted or purchased with in the first hour with all follow up contacts ignored. Therefore, I created this program to help automatically search and send a text alert when the desired item is posted and help me be one of the first ones to contact the listing.

## Prerequisites:
Use pip install to install the required packages and libraries. Also, a twilio account is needed and an authentication token is needed if you want to use the texting feature.

## Example:
Run the program, enter your category, enter the item to be searched.
